# Ex1
The project is a command-line tool based on Java. It is designed for converting and performing calculations with numbers in different bases. The program accepts strings representing numbers in bases ranging from binary (base 2) to hexadecimal (base 16). 
The numbers are expected to follow the format `<number>b<base>` (bases between 10-16 will be represented by A-G ).

the function will:
1. **Convert** the numbers into their decimal (base 10) equivalents.
2. **Prompt** the user for a target base for conversion (from base 2 to base 16).
3. Perform **addition** and **multiplication** on the two numbers.
4. **Display** the results in the user-specified base.
5. Store all inputs and results in an array and determine the **maximum value** among them, displaying it to the user.
